Isopods have a hepatopancreas that is a midgut gland with a likely primary function associated with digestion, and with a possible role in detoxification of metals, as has been observed in other crustaceans [(Guary and Negrel 1981)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0300-9629(81)90071-2).

Isopods also have an unsual biphasic moulting mode, in which they shed the posterior part of the cuticle prior to the anterior part [(Luquet and Marin 2004)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crpv.2004.07.015).
