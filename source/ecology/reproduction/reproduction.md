# Reproduction

- Exclusively sexual reproduction (Unwin and Stebbing 1920; Ridley and Thompson 1979). 
- Internally insemination (Wilson 1991) 
- Direct development within the brood pouch (Wolff 2009; Vick and Blum ; Mart√≠nez and Defeo 2006; Brusca RC 1985)
- Females produce a variable number of eggs (Arakelova 2001) and large females tend to produce more eggs (Arakelova 2001). 
- Females produce eggs even in the absence of males, which remain unfertilized (Needham 1942; Marchetti and Montalenti 1990). 
- Females are ready for fertilization only during a limited time window, when the oviducal openings are free (during approx. 24 hours following moulting). For that reason, the species practice a pre-copula (see below)
