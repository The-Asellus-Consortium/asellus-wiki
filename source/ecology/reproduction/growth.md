# Growth

- Growth is continuous (Steel 2009) and is dependent on periodic molting (refs)
- This species has been proposed to be great to study evolutionary changes of segment identity and patterning (Vick and Blum ; Mojaddidi et al. 2018).
- Like other isopods, molts in two phases (i.e. biphasic molting) by which the posterior and anterior halves of the body molt sequentially (George 1972; Unwin and Stebbing 1920; Marcus 1990; Balian et al. 2008), with an interval of time in between of approx. 24 hours in A. aquaticus; Unwin and Stebbing 1920; Marcus 1990; [(Luquet and Marin 2004)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crpv.2004.07.015)).
- Molting is controlled by the ecdysterone (i.e. 20-hydroxyecdysone) hormone (George 1972; Weltje L 2006; Oceanica ; Subramoniam 2000)
